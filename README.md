## Database Configuration

The application uses a hosted PostgreSQL database. No local database setup is required.

### Hosted Database Details
- **Host**: shortline.proxy.rlwy.net
- **Port**: 32455
- **Database**: railway
- **Username**: postgres
- **Password**: pFKtmPEPqKeFYIeMDkvfSGItkKKmcgbl

### Testing Database Connection

You can test the database connection using psql:

```bash
# Using psql command line tool
PGPASSWORD=pFKtmPEPqKeFYIeMDkvfSGItkKKmcgbl psql -h shortline.proxy.rlwy.net -U postgres -p 32455 -d railway

# Or using environment variable
export PGPASSWORD=pFKtmPEPqKeFYIeMDkvfSGItkKKmcgbl
psql -h shortline.proxy.rlwy.net -U postgres -p 32455 -d railway
```

### Database Schema

The database tables will be automatically created when you first run the backend server. The schema includes:
- `users` - User accounts and profiles
- `hazard_reports` - Hazard reports with both file and base64 image storage
- `report_comments` - Comments on reports
- `report_likes` - Like/dislike reactions on reports
- And other supporting tables

## Planned Features

- **Historical Hazard Analysis**: The system will track and analyze hazard reports over time to identify:
 - Recurring accident patterns at specific locations
 - High-risk areas based on incident frequency and severity
 - Seasonal or temporal hazard trends

### Intelligent Safety Alert System
- **Proximity-Based Audio Warnings**: When users approach dangerous areas, the system will:
 - Automatically detect when a user is within 200 meters of a high-risk location
 - Trigger audio alerts for areas with multiple high-sensitivity incidents
 - Play voice recordings such as: *"Dangerous area 200 meters ahead - multiple accidents reported at this location"*

- **Smart Alert Criteria**:
 - Activates when 2 or more accidents with high sensitivity ratings occur at the same location
 - Considers incidents across different dates to identify persistent hazard zones
 - Customizable sensitivity thresholds for different types of hazards

### Expanded Hazard Categories
- We are planning to add more categories for reporting, such as:
  - Broken traffic lights  
  - Faded road markings  
  - Damaged signboards  
  - Missing or damaged guardrails  
  - Other infrastructure-related hazards
 
## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
1. **Connection timeout**: Ensure your network allows connections to port 32455
2. **Authentication failed**: Double-check the password in your Config.toml
3. **Database not found**: Verify you're connecting to the "railway" database

### Backend Issues
1. **Port already in use**: Change the port in Config.toml or stop other services using port 8080
2. **Ballerina not found**: Make sure Ballerina is installed and in your PATH

### Frontend Issues
1. **API connection failed**: Ensure the backend is running on port 8080
2. **Environment variables**: Check that your .env file exists and has the correct values

### RDA Dashboard Issues
1. **Cannot access RDA features**: Ensure you registered with "RDA" user role
2. **Email verification pending**: Check rdasrilanka0@gmail.com for verification email
3. **Login failed**: Use the exact credentials provided above (case-sensitive)
4. **Gmail access issues**: Try the password "Rdasrilanka1@" for gmail access
5. **Role not showing**: Contact administrator to verify RDA role assignment
